# Pomodoro Technique

_The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student._
